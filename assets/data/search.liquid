Themost prominent is its store, which allows you to purchase a number ofthings the streamer curated. Depending on the purchase, these things appear in-game or affect thegame in some way. Another way viewers can interact with the game is through the mod’s polls. Thechoices in these polls depend heavily on what’s enabled in the mod.What Are Coins?Coins are the mod’s currency. You can view your balance by using the !bal command.What is Karma?Karma is a system in the mod that tries to limit the amount of negative events a viewer can purchase atone time. This system works by directly modifying that amount of coins viewers get everytime the modawards coins. This means that the lower you karma is, the lower your coin gain is. The hope is thatnegative events get spread out more so the colony can recover.How Do I Use Twitch Toolkit?You can use Twitch Toolkit in a number of ways – the most prominent way is through itscommands.
